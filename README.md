## General Information
#### Problem Statement
Build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- The validation score jumped from ~54% to 71% by addressing class imbalance and more augmented data.
- The difference between Train and Validation accuracy is around 20%, which can be improved by sourcing more data to train.
- The validation accuracy trend improved till epoch 18 and then started deteriorating gradually. Hence it appears the ideal epoch for the third model is around 18.
